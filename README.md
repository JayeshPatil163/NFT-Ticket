# EventChain 🎟️⛓️

EventChain is a **React Native dApp** for on-chain event ticketing, enabling organizers and attendees to interact seamlessly with blockchain-backed tickets.  
Attendees can buy tickets, verify them at events, and receive an NFT as proof of attendance. Organizers can create and manage events, verify attendees via QR code, and track participation — all powered by smart contracts.
